                            Hello! I'm a student at Northeastern University passionate about entrepreneurship and technology. 
                            I'm currently exploring the intersection of business and innovation, working on projects that 
                            combine my interests in startups and problem-solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong interest in understanding how businesses 
                            grow and scale. I'm particularly fascinated by the challenges that startups face and how innovative 
                            thinking can create solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about 
                            successful entrepreneurs, and connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for 
                            innovation. I believe that continuous learning and collaboration are key to personal and 
                            professional growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
